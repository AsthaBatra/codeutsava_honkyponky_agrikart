Macro nutrients are found in large quantities in plants, usually at least 0.1%. Micro nutrients are needed only in trace amounts and are usually counted in parts per million. Both are essential for happy, healthy plants.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Here are the most common macro nutrients found in soil:</h3>
<br>
<p>
<h4> Nitrogen </h4> Nitrogen is crucial to plants. It is found in amino acids, proteins, nucleic acids, and chlorophyll. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
<h4> 
Potassium </h4> Potassium is a positive ion that balances a plant’s negative ions. It also develops reproductive structures. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
<h4>
Calcium </h4>Calcium is an essential component of a plant’s cell walls that affects its permeability. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
<h4>
Magnesium </h4>
Magnesium is the central element in chlorophyll. It is a positive ion that balances a plant’s negative ions.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<h4>
 Phosphorus </h4> Phosphorus is essential to nucleic acids, ADP, and ATP. It also regulates root flower growth, cell division, and the formation of protein. 
 </p>
<br>
<p>
<h4>
 Sulphur  </h4> Sulphur is essential to protein structure and the vitamins thiamine and biotin. It is a coenzyme of vitamin A, which is important for respiration and fatty acid metabolism. 
<br> <br>

 <h3>Below are some of the most common micro nutrients found in soil:</h3>
<br>
<p>
<h4>
  Iron </h4>Iron is needed to make chlorophyll and is used in many oxidation/reduction reactions.
</p>
 <br>
<p>
<h4>
  Manganese </h4>Manganese is necessary for photosynthesis, respiration, and nitrogen metabolism.
  </p>
 <br>
<p>
<h4>
  Zinc </h4>Zinc helps synthesize proteins and is an essential element of growth control hormones.
  </p>
 <br>
<p>
<h4>
  Copper </h4>
  Copper is used to activate enzymes and is important in respiration and photosynthesis.

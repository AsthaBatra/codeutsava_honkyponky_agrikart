Thunderstorms help in fixing atmospheric N into the soils in the form fertilizer.

Generally, in areas of higher temperature, atmospheric pressure is low and in areas of low-temperature pressure is high. 

Wind direction and velocity is important for agricultural crop production. 

rainfall effects
Germination: Proper moisture is essential for seed germination. Different crops have different moisture requirement for germination and complete life cycle. Wheat seed requires 55% water absorption compared to its weight for germination. Mustard requires less water absorption. T. Aman and jute requires more rainfall to grow. Chili and Potato seed damages with higher rainfall.
N Fertilization: Atmospheric N added to the soil through rainfall.
Tillage and intercultural operations: Better performed under field capacity and wet condition depending on crops. Upland farming needs special practices.
Insects, pests/diseases/weeds: kharif-1> kharif-2> rabi due comparatively higher rainfall and excess moisture.
Photosynthesis: Less Net photosynthesis in more cloudy days.
Growth, development and yield: rabi> kharif-2> kharif-1 due to comparatively controlled moisture contents.
Soil erosion: higher in excessive rainfall and open field.
Product quality: rabi> kharif-2> kharif-1 due comparatively controlled.
Moisture contents: Grapes ate sour in rainy seasons.


temp effect
Germination: Proper temperature is essential for seed germination. Too high and too low temperature prohibits seed germination. Different crops have different term requirement for germination and complete life cycle.
Photosynthesis: Occurs within -6 to 370 Growth, development and yield: Production of dry matter occurs when soil temperature ranges bet 20-30 0C.
Flower initiation: Certain crops require low temperature for flower initiation and Flowering. E.g. Cabbage, cauliflower, carrot turnip etc flower in low temperature.
Life span: rabi> kharif-2> kharif-1 due to comparatively reduced respiration rate.
Transpiration/evaporation: kharif-1> kharif-2> rabi due comparatively higher temperature.
Insects, pests/diseases/weeds: Transpiration/evaporation: kharif-1> kharif-2> rabi due comparatively higher temperature.
Product quality: better quality in relatively low temperature (depending on crops)
Yield: rabi> kharif-2> kharif-1 due to comparatively reduced respiration rate and higher net photosynthetic rate
